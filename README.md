PyTorch implementation for different style-transfer model

- [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08155) Johnson et al.

- [Multi-style Generative Network for Real-time Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06953) Zhang et al.

The code allows training 

## Prerequisites
- Linux
- NVIDIA GPU
- CUDA CuDNN

## Somethings to think about later:

- Create a trainer class and parameterize model definition.
- Use conda for environment configuration.
